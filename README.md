# AirspaceDroneMobility

# Introduction

All recreational drone pilots are required by the FAA and LAANC to fly at or below 400 feet above the ground when in uncontrolled airspace at all times. Often times drone operation can often be confusing for both pilots and the communities they fly in. The problem is determining the safest drone operational locations or routes in communities. My solution is to help pilots make an informed decision before planning their route by assigning different risk profiles to local communities.
